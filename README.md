### Use Case:

Implement an end2end Airport Management system that can be configured for a given airport (Web interface or Mobile app interface with supporting Backend APIs), that integrates Airline Flight Schedules, Gate Assignments, Baggage Claim assignment for arriving flights

The emphasis here is on team collaboration, so the points awarded will be based on individual contributions to the team and how the team performed overall.

## Design Decisions:  
### MERN stack :  
We chose MERN stack because it provides faster development using library functions from React. It is easier to test and run applications, bother server-side and front end.  
#### Backend :
##### Node.js and Expressjs
Nodejs is a serer-side Javascript framework, provides event-driven and non-blocking i/o. Express is another server side framework which runs on the Nodejs platform. It is easy to configure and customize. 
#### Frontend : 
##### ReactJS  
We chose ReactJS, a Javascript front-end library to make UI development easy. Using React, we imported a lot of predefined UI packages which saved a lot of development time. Redux, along with React components provides a state which is maintained globally across the application. This helps one component track changes to the other components.  
#### Database :
##### MongoDB  
MongoDB is a non-relational database which we used as part of the MERN stack. MongoDB has document oriented storage and is robust, flexible and scalable. It provides single-master usage with replication support.
