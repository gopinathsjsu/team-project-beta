# XP Core Values 

### Communication:  
We have been communicating and collaborating as a team to ensure no single team member's work has been blocked or delayed under any circumstance. Our primary modes of communication have been through Google Meet and WhatsApp. We have acknowledged each others ideas and views and have reached common ground on several issues with an open mind.  
### Feedback:  
We have been giving each other valuable feedback on each other's work and have been regularly reviewing each others code to avoid duplicate work. We have retrospected on each sprint to make ourselves better and more efficient for the next ones.
